# Ecommerce

E-Commerce is associated with the buying and selling of products and services via computer network today. Business-to-consumer (B2C) is the retail part of e-commerce on the internet. It is when businesses sell products, services or information directly to consumers. It is similar like amazon, flipkart etc.

The entire project is built on using spring and hibernate technologies. In our project we also worked on my-sql to store the data at the backend process and we designed UI part based on html,css and bootstrap  at the frontend.
